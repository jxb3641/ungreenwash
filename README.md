# unGreenWash 

## Introduction
This project utilizes OpenAI's LLMs and publically available data including ESG reports, SEC 10-K filings, and earnings call transcripts to build an app that searches and summarizes these data to empower users with ESG-related information needed to invest responsibly.   

## Setup

### Virtual Environment Setup
This project was built using Python 3.8.4. 
First, clone this repository: 

`git clone https://github.com/jxb3641/ungreenwash.git`

In a terminal: 
- change directories into the cloned repo
- Create a new virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`.  You know you did it right if you see the activated virtual environment in your terminal prompt, like 
    
    `(.venv) user@workstation: ~/OpenAI-hackathon-Scope3$ `

- Install the `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - This will take >20 minutes because of the haystack module
- If you face an error including the "rust" keyword, you need to install the rust compiler by running this command and selecting the default options: 
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`


### Setting up OpenAI API keys
To use OpenAI, you need to set up your API keys locally.

#### For Generic Python Scripts
To interface with OpenAI, you need to set up an API key. 
- Go to openai.com.
- Click on the "API" tab on the top right.
- Click on "Login" button at the top right.
- Sign up with the email address you provided to OpenAI when signing up for this hackathon.  You should see "oai-hackathon-2022-team-8" as one of your organizations.
- Click on your initial on the top right. A dropdown menu should expand.
- Click on "View API Keys" -> "Create a new secret key"
- Copy this key.
- Create a `.env` file in repo root, with the following line, replacing `YourKeyHere` with your API key: 

    OPENAI_API_KEY=(CopiedKeyHere) 

- Save and exit.
- Whenever you want to use the OpenAI API in your scripts, be sure to include this line after you import openai and os, so your local client knows your key: 

    openai.api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

#### For Streamlit Scripts

For the `streamlit_10k_investigation.py` streamlit app (or any other streamlit apps) to be able to use your OpenAI API key, you need to create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file, with the line below, replacing `YourKeyHere` with the API key:

    openai_api_key = "(YourKeyHere)"

If you're creating your own Streamlit script, be sure to get the secret using the following line after you import openai:

    openai.api_key = st.secrets["openai_api_key"]

### Setting up Cohere API keys
To interface with Cohere, you will also need an API key.
- Go to https://docs.cohere.ai/
- Click on "Get your API key"
- Once you set up an account (you can create one with google), you will get an API key
- Copy the key from your dashboard (https://dashboard.cohere.ai/) to the .streamlit/secrets.toml file, like this:
```
cohere_api_key = "abcdefg"
```

## Overview

### data/ directory
This directory contains the data being read in.  This directory is empty.  To populate the data directory:
- Download the **entire** `datasets/ind_lists` directory from the [Hackathon drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j-I-hBuqYZQWMPNO2nWIrRDwuMFLeYMN?usp=share_link) and unzip it into `data/` so the EDGARFilingUtils scripts can correctly fetch data. The final structure should contain `data/ind_lists/4_food_bev/` and `data/ind_lists/11_transportation`, with each subdirectory containing the `10k/` and `transcripts/` subdirectories, along with `.csv` files.

#### 10K `.txt` file structure
For each Submission ID there are assumed to be three `.txt` files:
- The entire parsed 10-K filing, named as `submission-id.txt` converted into text after HTML/XBRL tags have been replaced with newlines.
- The Item1 section of this filing, named as `submission-id_item1.txt` where newlines and markdown tags have been removed.
- The Item7/MDA section of this filing, named as `submission-id_mda.txt` where newlines and markdown tags have have been removed.

### Convenience function modules

#### EDGARFilingUtils.py
Contains convenience functions for loading in 10-K filings data described above, splitting text, concatenating text fragments and finding text containing any hits of a pre-defined list of climate keywords in the text. 

#### OpenAIUtils.py
Contains wrapper functions for calling the OpenAI API.  Currently contains wrappers for the completion and embedding API endpoints.

#### streamlit_10K_investigation.py
An interactive Streamlit application to interface with the 10-K text in Item1 and MDA sections. 
After setting up the project and activating your virtual environment, call 

`streamlit run streamlit_10K_investigation.py`

and the app will open in your local browser. 

#### streamlit_10K_contextual_question_tester.py
An interactive Streamlit application that shows the 10-K text for a given submission id, and allows for interfacing with OpenAI's completion models.
After setting up the project and activating your virtual environment, call

`streamlit run streamlit_10K_contextual_question_tester.py`

and the app will open in your local browser.
